PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IN SKI TOWNS: AN ANALYSIS FOR TRANSIT FOR THE SKI TOWN WORKFORCE AND VISITING POPULATIONS
Perry Jean Schaffner
Thesis on the west coast of the US. Describes ski towns. Analyses which kind of population are living there. Problem for the permanent residents to afford living there.
Challenges for transportation (mountain, weather conditions)
How europeans do it better (pedestrian towns, long and short distance PT, ).
Environemental change challenges (natural snow and water availabitlity, erosion, energy)
Enjoyement impact (nicer towns with less cars or traffic jams)
Transportation searves a niche market (theme parks/ cruise ships)
Question of funding (often free, paid by tourist tax,)
Problem of accessing the ski town (long distance for tourists)
Transportation for the workforce
Headway (frequency of buses) for combination witha  parking. A maximum headway of 30 minutes should be used, but 15 minute or less headways are much more efficient. Longer headways increase the likelihood of missing a bus and having to wait for the next one.
